# Employee-Churn-Model
This repository contains the data set, code and documents for an employee churn model developed in R

# Problem Statement 
An employee churn model is a predictive model which based on various factors will predict if an employee will leave the company or not. Apart from that, the model will also analyse certain factors like age, gender and marital status of the employee in depth in order to produce specific analysis if age, gender or marital status effects the employee attrition or not. 

There are certain questions that this model will answer. 

Which factors impact the employee's decision the most in leaving the company?

Is there a specific age group or gender leaving the company?

What are the precautionary measures an organization can take in order to reduce the employee attrition?

# Dataset 

This model is based on the HR Analytics dataset released by IBM. 

The dataset contains the Attrition varibale as a dependent variable. 

Other variables like age, daily rate, business travel, department, distance from home, education field, environment satisfaction, gender, hourly rate, job level, job role, job satisfaction, marital status, number of previous companies, overtime, salary hike, performance rating, stock option level, total working years and work life balance are the dependent variables on which the attrition of the employee would depend on. 

# Group Members
The project is developed as part of Multivariate Analysis, a graduate level course at Rutgers University and the group for this project includes Vishv Brahmbhatt, Amisha Sancheti and Ananya Shivhare. The project is developed under the guidance and directions of Professor Ronak Parikh.
